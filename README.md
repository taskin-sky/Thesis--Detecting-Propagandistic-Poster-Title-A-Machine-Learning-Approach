#Detecting Propagandistic Poster Title: A Machine Learning Approach
In this modern era, information can swiftly spread across various platforms such
as newspapers, world wide web, posters and movies often before its authenticity is
ascertained. The advantage of this is taken by some insidious men or news portals or any group with a heinous motive. Misinformation is the root of many big
crux.All this misinformation spread by the opportunist sides is often referred to as
propaganda. Since influences are created by misinformation or propagandistic content,identification of propaganda plays a vital role as it helps to keep the peace in
society. Propaganda identification refers to the detection of any invalid, misleading
news, poster title or misinformation which does not have enough grounds for validation. Already a few works on propaganda identification from social media have been
done but research on identifying propagandistic poster titles is still in its infancy
stages. One of the key causes of less research in this field is the notion regarding the
impact of visual propaganda through posters. Our research investigates a manually
created dataset and different type of machine learning models to create an efficient
technique for identifying propaganda from poster titles, yielding precise results.
