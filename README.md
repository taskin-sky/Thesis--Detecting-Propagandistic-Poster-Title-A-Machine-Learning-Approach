# Propaganda Identification in Poster Titles

## Overview

In the modern era, information spreads rapidly across various platforms such as newspapers, the world wide web, posters, and movies, often before its authenticity is confirmed. This rapid dissemination can be exploited by individuals or groups with malicious motives, leading to the spread of misinformation and propaganda. Our research focuses on developing an efficient technique for identifying propaganda in poster titles using machine learning models.

## Introduction

Propaganda refers to actions performed by individuals or groups with the intention of persuading the opinions of target individuals. It has been used since 300 BCE to promote religious beliefs and political ideologies. Over time, especially during the 19th century and the World Wars, propaganda grew significantly due to increased literacy rates and improved printing technologies. Today, with the advent of the internet and social media, propaganda spreads more swiftly and widely than ever before.

### The Problem

Misinformation and propaganda can incite hatred, manipulate public opinion, and lead to criminal activities. Identifying and mitigating propaganda is crucial to maintaining peace and stability in society. While there has been some research on identifying propaganda in social media, the field of identifying propagandistic poster titles remains under-explored.

### Our Approach

Our research investigates a manually created dataset and employs various machine learning models to develop an efficient technique for identifying propaganda in poster titles. By accurately detecting propaganda, we aim to prevent its spread and mitigate its negative impacts on society.

## Methodology

The methodology section of our research outlines the following:

1. **Research Strategy**: The overall approach to the study.
2. **Data Collection**: How data was gathered and curated.
3. **Data Preparation**: Steps taken to preprocess and prepare the data for analysis.
4. **Classification Techniques**: The machine learning models and algorithms used to classify and identify propaganda in poster titles.
5. **Rationale**: The reasoning behind selecting specific methodologies and how they align with the study's goals and research questions.

## Results

Our proposed system's steps and results are illustrated and detailed in the research. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we have developed a method that yields precise results in identifying propaganda in poster titles.

## Conclusion

Propaganda in poster titles is a significant issue that can have far-reaching effects on public opinion and behavior. Our research contributes to the field by providing a robust methodology for detecting such propaganda, thereby helping to mitigate its impact on society.
